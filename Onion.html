            <h3>Product Description</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Soil: Onions thrive in well-drained, fertile, loamy soil rich in organic matter, with a pH range of 6.0–7.0. The soil should be loose and deep enough to accommodate the bulb's growth. Heavy or waterlogged soils can cause bulb rot, so it's essential to ensure proper drainage. Adding compost or well-rotted manure helps improve soil fertility and texture.</li>

                <li>Climate: Onions are cool-season crops that grow best in temperatures between 13–25°C. They can tolerate some frost, but extremely cold weather can damage the plant. Onions require long days (14–16 hours of daylight) for proper bulb formation, making them ideal for growing in temperate regions with long daylight hours. They require full sunlight for optimal growth.</li>

                <li>Fertilizer: Onions are moderate feeders, requiring a balanced fertilization regimen. Before planting, work compost or well-decomposed manure into the soil. During the growing season, apply a balanced fertilizer (N-P-K) to encourage healthy growth, but avoid high-nitrogen fertilizers as they can promote excessive leaf growth at the expense of bulbs. Side-dress with compost when the plants are about 10 cm tall and again in mid-season.Like using sour buttermilk, neem oil, lemon etc.</li>

                <li>Planting: Onions can be grown from seeds, sets (small bulbs), or transplants. For seed planting, sow seeds 1–2 cm deep, spaced 2–4 cm apart in rows 30–45 cm apart. If using onion sets, plant them 3–4 cm deep, spaced 10–15 cm apart in rows. For transplants, plant young onion seedlings with the roots spread out and the tops at soil level.</li>

                <li>Watering: Onions need consistent moisture, especially during the bulb formation stage. Water deeply and regularly, but ensure that the soil is well-drained to prevent waterlogging, which can cause root rot. Onions are sensitive to drought, so irrigation is crucial during dry spells. Drip irrigation is ideal to keep the soil consistently moist without wetting the foliage.</li>

                <li>Weeding: Onions should be kept free from weeds, particularly early in the growing season when they are still small. Weeds can compete for nutrients and water, reducing yield. Mulching around the base of the plants helps suppress weeds and conserve moisture. Be careful when weeding to avoid damaging the shallow roots of the onion plants.</li>

                <li>Thinning: If planting from seed, thin the seedlings to about 10–15 cm apart once they have developed a few leaves. This ensures that the onions have enough space to grow and develop large bulbs. For sets and transplants, spacing should be about 10–15 cm apart in rows.</li>

                <li>Harvesting: Onions are typically ready for harvest when the tops start to yellow and fall over, which usually occurs 90–120 days after planting, depending on the variety. Once the onions have matured, gently lift them out of the soil with a fork or hand, being careful not to damage the bulbs. If growing for storage, allow the onions to cure in a warm, dry place for 1–2 weeks, allowing the outer skins to dry and the necks to harden.</li>

                <li>Post-harvest Management: After harvesting, cure onions by placing them in a shaded, dry area with good air circulation. Once cured, trim the roots and cut the tops off, leaving about 2.5 cm of the neck. Store cured onions in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area. Proper storage is essential for long shelf life. Onions should be stored in mesh bags or baskets and can last for several months under ideal conditions.</li>
